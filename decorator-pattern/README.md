The UML Diagram of Decorator Pattern looks like following:

# Compile the code using following ways
<!-- `g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test.cpp display.cpp weatherdata.cpp` -->

or

<!-- `g++ -c -std=c++11 -Wall test.cpp display.cpp weatherdata.cpp` -->

<!-- `g++ -std=c++11 -Wall test.o display.o weatherdata.o` -->

and run the generated executable `a.out`.
