The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

The UML Diagram of Adapter Pattern looks like following:

1. Using Composition

2. Using Inheritance

# Example coded here
Following 2 examples are coded here:

1. Using composition 
2. Using inheritance

Both of them are adapting a turkey to be used as duck class. The class diagram is as shown below.

# Compile the code using following ways
To compile composition example:

`g++ -std=c++11 -Wall adpatercompose.cpp xyz.cpp abc.cpp`

To compile inheritance example:

`g++ -std=c++11 -Wall adpaterinherit.cpp xyz.cpp abc.cpp`

and run the generated executable `a.out`.
